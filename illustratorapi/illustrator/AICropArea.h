	This suite allows you to activate, access, and modify crop areas in Illustrator documents.
	Illustrator maintains a list of crop areas in a document, and these functions allow
	you to iterate through the list. The active crop area is the one returned by
	\c #AIDocumentSuite::GetDocumentCropBox(), which is displayed with crop marks,
	and which is used when saving or exporting to a file.

	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAICropAreaSuite and \c #kAICropAreaSuiteVersion.
