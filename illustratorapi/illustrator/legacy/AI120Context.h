/** Use the Context Suite to save and restore the application context. An application
	context consists of an Artwork context, and an Undo context.

	Product independent plug-ins don’t always know about the application
	context. For example, ADM is host application independent; it knows
	nothing about the application environment in which it is operating in.

	Pushing the application context within an ADM plug-in tells ADM about the
	state of the application at any given time. Your plug-in will want to do this
	in init, drawer, notifier, and tracker procs. For example, if your plug-in has
	an ADM non-modal dialog which only makes changes to itself, you wouldn’t
	need to push the application context. However, if your plug-in makes
	changes to the artwork you will need to push the app context. */
