	/**	A routine which takes an AIColor and applies it to an AIPathStyle, doing what
		is generally wanted when people ask "why is it such a pain to simply set the
		color of an object?"  

		The path style map parameter is optional.

		If the newColor is a gradient or pattern, only the global object handle is
		relevant - the vector and transform fields are ignored. When the old pathStyle
		is already of the same kind, the existing vector and transform are used; if
		it is not, then default values are used. If newColor is a spot color, though,
		the tint is used. This is because this API is mainly intended for the use of
		the Swatches palette. Swatches contain tint info for spot colors, but they
		do not record gradient vector (even relative vector) or pattern transform data.

		If matchColor is non-null, then the onStroke parameter is ignored, and the
		newColor is applied to the fill and/or the stroke, whichever of them has the
		same color as matchColor. The matching is exact, including color space. This
		will never assign paint to an unpainted stroke or fill unless the matchColor
		is kNoneColor.

		If matchColor is null, then the newColor is applied to the stroke if onStroke
		is true, or to the fill if onStroke is false. (To apply to both, you must
		call this twice.)

		When it can't gather things from the pathStyle (which is assumed to be the "old"
		color of the object in question), it first looks at the current paint style and
		if that's not helpful, uses some reasonable (to me) defaults.  Search for the
		text "DEFAULT" below to find those if you want to muck with them. Defaults
		are only necessary when changing from one kind of color to another (e.g.,
		from a solid to a pattern or gradient) or when assigning color to a fill
		or stroke that was previously unpainted.

		The destination arthandle is used for the case where it needs to figure out the
		gradient vector based on the object's bounds. In the case where the object is
		part of a compound path, the bounds are calculated from the entire compound
		group.

		If whatChanged is non-null, returns in *whatChanged an AIColorUsedHow value
		indicating what part of the pathStyle (fill and/or stroke) was changed. (It is
		not necessary to do a SetPathStyle on the object if the old path style is the
		same as the new one.)

		or graph designs that are attached to the object. (Indirect usages inside patterns
		and gradients are to be replaced by defining a new pattern or gradient, then calling

		that was redefined. Indirect usage inside graph designs are similar, except that

	/** Sets the syncInitialPathStyle state

		When syncInitialPathStyle is TRUE, the initial path style is 
		synchronized with the current path style, and the UI in the swatches palette,
		color palette, and toolbox report the current path style. This synchronization
		happens when the selection changes and when GetCurrentPathStyle/SetCurrentPathStyle
		or GetInitialPathStyle/SetInitialPathStyle are called. syncInitialPathStyle is
		true the majority of the time.
		
		When syncInitialPathStyle is FALSE, the initial path style and the current path style
		become independant. In this mode GetCurrentPathStyle/SetCurrentPathStyle does not 
		affect the initial path style and GetInitialPathStyle/SetInitialPathStyle does not affect
		the current path style and the current selection. The UI in the swatches palette,
		color palette, and toolbox also report the initial path style rather than the current
		path style.

		Why this is useful:
		Sometimes a tool may want to maintain a "tool path style" that is not modified when
		the selection changes. This	allows the user to have a selection, choose
		a specific tool and color, and not have the color apply to the current
		selection. Such behavior is useful for the paintbucket tool, for example. To get
		this behavior the tool should set the syncState to true 
		and use GetInitialPathStyle/SetInitialPathStyle in place of
		GetCurrentPathStyle/SetCurrentPathStyle while the tool is selected. */
