/**	@ingroup Suites
	This suite provides functions for creating and managing file-format plug-ins,
	which extend the number of file formats that Illustrator can read and write.

	Reading a format can be transparent to the user; when a file of the
	defined type is selected in the Open dialog, your file format plug-in
	creates artwork in the Illustrator document. If there is a plug-in that writes
	a file format, that format appears in the Save As dialog as an option for the user
	to select. If it is selected, the plug-in walks the artwork tree and writes out
	information on the artwork in the appropriate manner. If your plug-in needs more
	parameters for either reading or writing, it defines a modal dialog to interact
	with the user.

	Plug-ins tell Illustrator about the file formats they
	support by specifying platform file information: the type (such as \c 'ART3')
	in Mac OS, or the extension (such as \c '.AI') in Windows. Plug-ins also indicate
	what read/write capabilities they support.

	One plug-in can register multiple formats. Illustrator handles some parts of the
	file I/O process, and the plug-in does the rest.

	A file-format plug-in receives message actions telling it to:

	\li Check if a file can be read, The Check selector is sent only to plug-ins
		that can read files. It extends the simple type checking done by the  Open dialog.
	\li Ask for parameters.  This selector can be ignored if the plug-in does not need
		user input.
	\li Go. In response, your plug-in executes the read or write operation.

	If a file format plug-in can read, files of its registered file type appear
	in the file list of the Open dialog. In addition to screening by file type,
	Illustrator sends a selector giving a plug-in a chance to check that the
	file can be read. This is useful in the case of text files or files from a
	different file system. If more than one format matches the type, Illustrator
	determines which plug-in should actually open the file, asking the user if necessary.

	If a file format plug-in supports both reading and writing, when reading it should
	store any information about the file needed to write the file back to disk. It can
	store data (for example, the pixel depth of an EPS preview) in the plug-in’s globals,
	or in a parameter block. The reference to a block should be attached to the document
	using \c #AIDocumentSuite::SetDocumentFileFormatParameters(). Illustrator keeps this
	parameter-block reference with the document. The plug-in can retrieve it when the
	document is being saved.

	When the user does a Save, by default Illustrator uses the same file format that was
	used to read the file. If the file format does not support writing, the Save As
	dialog appears to let the user choose the save format. All file format plug-ins
	that support saving appear in the format menu of this dialog.

	If you need information from the user to open or save a file, you can present a
	dialog when the ask-for-parameters message is received. When saving files, this
	will be after the Save As dialog has appeared. Your plug-in should save the
	information it collects, keeping it with the document to use for later saves.

	When the go message is received, file formats that read files typically parse
	the input file and create Illustrator artwork using API calls. File formats for
	saving Illustrator artwork traverse the artwork database and write out all
	pertinent information.

	\li Acquire this suite using \c #SPBasicSuite::AcquireSuite() with the constants
		\c #kAIFileFormatSuite and \c #kAIFileFormatVersion.
