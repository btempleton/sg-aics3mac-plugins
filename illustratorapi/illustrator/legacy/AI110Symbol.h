		If the art object is null, then the entire artwork is searched. In this case,
		the #kSearchDescendants flag is assumed even if it is not on in the searchScope,
		because it is meaningless to search the whole artwork unless you look inside layer groups.

		The targetSymbol can be null; if so the art is searched for any symbol usage
		If the targetSymbol is not null, then the remaining three parameters are all ignored!

		The oneFoundSymbol pointer can also be null. It is ignored if targetSymbol is not null.
		
		If targetSymbol is null, and oneFoundSymbol is not null, and the art object uses exactly
		one symbol definition within the scope searched, then *oneFoundSymbol will be returned as
		that symbol. If it uses multiple symbols, the function returns true but *oneFoundSymbol
		is returned null.

		If it uses multiple symbols and allFoundSymbols is non-null, then *allFoundSymbols is
		returned as a handle to an array of all those symbols and *foundCount. Like the
		AIMatchingArtSuite, the memory is allocated by ArtUsesSymbolPattern, and must be freed
		by the calling plugin using AIMdMemorySuite::MdMemoryDisposeHandle().
		
		*oneFoundSymbol is mostly intended for the Symbols palette to decide which symbol to select,
		and if an object uses multiple symbols then nothing is selected. The searchScope in this
		type of usage should not include #kSearchNestedSymbolPatterns, because if symbol A's
		definition includes symbol B, and the user selects an instance of symbol A, we want
		to consider symbol A to be selected. But if they select a particle set containing
		instances of both symbol A and symbol B, we want to select neither symbol in the palette. 
		
		*allFoundSymbols with a null art object is mostly intended for implementing the
		"Select All Unused" command in the Symbols palette.
		
		*allFoundSymbols with a non-null art object is mostly intended for examining which symbol
		patterns are referenced by a plugin group that puts multiple symbols in its dictionary,
		such as a particle set.

		Currently unimplemented: If globalObjectUsage is not null, we additionally report whether
		the symbol was found inside graph designs or inside other symbols. See #AISymbolGlobalObjectUsage.
		(This does not affect the searchScope, so if there was a non-null input art object, any
		non-zero return value will mean that it was found inside a graph design or symbol that
		was used in that object.)

		an object containing such active elements is not always visually identical to transforming

		This function can be safely used with fill patterns and brush patterns as well as
		with symbol patterns (see the AIPatternSuite and AIBrushPatternSuite.) Therefore the
		description below refers to "patterns". This should be taken to mean a symbol pattern
		if passed a symbol pattern, a fill pattern if passed a fill pattern, etc.

		The function was not needed for fill patterns because they are usually retargetted
		indirectly using the AIPathStyleSuite, and it was not needed for brush patterns
		because they are usually retargetted indirectly using the AIObjectSetSuite. But
		there is no corresponding data structure that wraps around a symbol pattern in
		a palette.

		If the srcPattern is not in the current document, but there is already a pattern
		in the current document with the same name and the same definition, returns the

		with the same definition art, and a name based on the srcPattern's name (possibly
		appending numbers if the srcPattern's name is assigned to a pattern in the current
		document with a different definition.) All other global objects (colors, patterns,
		brushes, styles, etc.) used indirectly in the definition are similarly retargetted,
		using an existing object if one matches and creating a new one otherwise.

		For purposes of determining sameness, a listed symbol never matches an unlisted one,
