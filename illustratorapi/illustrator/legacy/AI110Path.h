/**
	The shape of art of type kPathArt is defined by one or more path segments. It
	has two other attributes, whether the path is closed and whether it is a guide.
	In addition, it has paint attibutes associated with it in a path style (see the
	AIPathStyleSuite).

	Every segment of a path corresponds to an anchor point (anchor points are
	the path handles that are visible when the path is selected). The segment
	count is the number of anchor points on the path, including the two at each
	end. A segment is defined by the AIPathSegment structure.

	The in and out points of a segment define the tangent of the curve at a point
	Note that the in point for initial and final segments of an open path are not
	used.

	A segment can be a corner point or a smooth point. If the segment is a
	corner (corner == true), the in and out points can be anywhere. To make a
	straight line, place the in and out points of each end on their p points.

	Segment numbers begin at zero. Illustrator limits the number of segments in
	a path to 8191. A path may consist of a single anchor point.

	A path can be open or closed. If a path is open, it is defined only by its
	segments. If it is closed, a 'phantom' segment is added by Illustrator
	between the first and last anchor points. It uses the out tangent of the last
	segment and the in segment of the first.

	Some paths double as guides. In all other respects they are paths, having
	segments, corner points and close attributes.
